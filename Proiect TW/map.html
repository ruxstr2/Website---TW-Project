      <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Blessing of Wghyrios</h3>
      <p class="par">In the wake of Wghyrios' defeat in 1752, knowing full well that his successor would not see the next spring and that the Age of the Mid-Kings had finally run its course, representatives of all peoples gathered at The Fall to discuss the new face of Verayn'eez, striving to make it a uniquely identifiable great city rather than a lesser player forever dwelling in the shadow of Rashii. While their parents were at the gathering, a handful of children formed a council of their own and created their version of a fitting chevron for their beloved city, including several mocking motifs: the spineless Serpent Ivy (the Geldri bowing down to all invading populations), the stolen crown of the Harasi (as a Jelomoreni king had subjugated the Harasi in their own major ruling district), the moon shining as if wanting to be the sun (the Serraszi and their ever dwindling influence, despite all appearances), the desert flower Perun'yya (said to thrive in blood-filled soil, just like the Kehlami). Finally, they named their drawing Blessing of Wghyrios, the fallen Jelomoreni king who had ruthlessly persecuted his own people. Unbeknownst to their parents, the children sent the new crest to Rashii the same night. By the time the Elders had caught wind, it was already too late and the new symbol of Verayn'eez had already been included in the official Harasi Records.</p>

      <h3>Dirrimunlen</h3>
      <p class="par">The frightening tale of sea searpents haunting Serraszi trader charts made its way into the heart of the Veraynzi harbour district in the wake of several devastating ship wrecks in the mid 12<sup>th</sup> century. The Dirrimunlen were said to take the appearance of dolphins to fool the sailors before they realized that the creatures were in fact seperate heads belonging to the same giant beast. The ever hungry sea serpents were solitary hunters, for one would be enough to wreak havok among a full fleet. Curiously, almost all accounts of fateful meetings with these beasts ceased with the arrival of the Kehlami some 250 years later. Some say that so much blood had been spilled by these faithless warriors, that the Dirrimunlen could not fathom to remain in close proximity to such cursed shores and disappeared in the south-west of the Geldren Sea.</p>

      <h3>Oanhoaeya Alueio (The Slithering Tree)</h3>
      <p class="par">While on the subject of snakes, let us move inland for the next one, while at the same time taking a step back troughout the centuries, towards the very first settlements around what is nowadays Verayn'eez. Legend has it that when the Geldri arrived on the coast, the sign of the slithering tree could be seen in several cliffsides, rocks or even sculpted in the bark of trees. It was said that no oasis could exist without being marked by this ancient land-dwelling spirit. Even today, the sign of Oanhoaeya (its unusual name coming directly from a long extinct Geldri dialect) can be seen embelished on old and new walls alike. This spirit is said to be primarily peaceful, showing little to no hostility towards the "Faoasai" (outsiders, every other ethnic group that came after the Geldri), but can become extremely violent when its people are in grave danger (during the Age of the Mid-Kings, several Harasi tyrants in this area are said to have succumbed to the curse placed upon them by Oanhoaeya Alueio).</p>

      <h3>Perr'hozs the Pink Councillor</h3>
      <p class="par">What would any account of old legends be without the ever essential tale of an infamous love affair? Perr'hozs (literally the name of a local flower) the Pink was a modest mixed-blood Serraszi-Kehlami fishmonger until he was seduced by the one mistress who would subjugate him for the rest of his life: Power. His love for power was so raw and intense, that it made him do insane acts - for love, he used to say - and just like any self-respecting scandalous affair, his unholy desire shook society in some unexpected ways. He became an official Councillor on behalf of the Serraszi in 1841 and immediately immersed himself in the treacherous games of the High Council Court in Rashii, with ties to their agents in Verayn'eez. His mad schemes saw the choosing of a new capital at the 52<sup>nd</sup> Gathering of Rashinem District, with approval from his allies in Rashii. Thus, Verayn'eez became the Capital (for a mere six months), before some equally mad schemes saw Perr'hozs betrayed by his hungry lover. It is said that those who assasinated him brought his mortal remains to be buried under a new street in Rashii, which would later be called Wilted Bloom.</p>

      <h3>Moay'iiz Meckyiosz Ritual (Free the Children)</h3>
      <p class="par">Mixed marriages have marked the Veraynzi social scene since the very beginning, but once the Kehlami settled for good and the ethnic distribution suffered no more drastic changes, they became a problem to the national minorities. Children born to these couples had no clear cultural identity and soon the Elders saw that a significant part of the new Veraynzi generations strayed from customs and norms to allow for a broader term relating to faith and patriotism, a fact that could benefit only the one ruling population of the Peninsula in the long term - the Harasi themselves. Afraid that they would drown in the waves of coming generations, the Veraynzi designed for all the city's mixed-blood inhabitants, regardless of origins, a ritual known as Moay'iiz Meckyiosz. When coming of age, children of mixed marriages were made to choose the ethnic group to whom they would adhere for the rest of their lives, taking after only one of their parents. Even though the ceremony was viewed as purely formal, it must have had some effect, for no ethnic background was ever forgotten in this city, unlike in some other parts of Harasoren.</p>
