      <h3>Early settlements and the birth of Ehlian</h3>
      <p>The Geldri were first - this can not be denied. Sufficient archeological discoveries, as well as surviving written records attest to the fact that this tribe formed the first settlements in and around the area of the nowadays thriving city. However, those who elevated these sparse tipi camps to a larger settlement and then to a city in its own right were the Serraszi - seafaring peoples who proceeded to establish trading colonies on the coasts of their neighboring masses of land. A few decades after their arrival, Ehlian was born as such a colony. Rumours also played an important role in the choosing of the exact location for the nascent city: Geldri shamans told the newly arrived Serraszi of the Heart of the Cliff, a supposedly blessed piece of land above fresh underground springs, around which most households would be built. Even though no concrete evidence was ever put forth, it is a most common belief that the Heart of the Cliff is the same as the area now known as The Fall - right south of the city center.</p>

      <h3>Thriving through trade and tribal arrival</h3>
      <p>The Serraszi colony's wealth would gradually increase over time, from establishing routes by both land and sea to the most important trade centers of the surrounding kingdoms. The city's allurement became increasingly obvious over the next few centuries as more Serraszi and tribal waves arrived to trade and then settle. When the Jelomoreni Merchant Guild drew the Golden Caravan Road, Ehlian was counted among the original destinations, one of five thriving coastal cities on the Western Harasor Peninsula. By the end of the 14<sup>th</sup> century, Ehlian became home to four major ethnic groups: the Serraszi, the Geldri, the Jelomoreni and, of course, the Harasi. </p>

      <h3>Arrival of the Kehlami</h3>
      <p>The beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> century brought on the first wave of the Kehlami - the nomadic relatives of the Kehlrom plain dwellers in the North. With conquest in mind, but somehow never aimed towards Ehlian itself (a curious historical fact, given that the rest of the coastal cities often suffered in the face of their brutal raids), they repeatedly made their way south towards Rashii - the Capital of then and now - , only to end up, in the span of a few decades, assimilated in different regions as a stand-alone ethnic group, including in Ehlian. Adaptable and determined, the Kehlami left their wondering ways behind and settled throughout the Harasi Peninsula, their population second only to the Harasi themselves. Their powerful influence gave our city its final shaping and it is in the mid-to-late 15<sup>th</sup> century that Ehlian became officially known as Verayn'eez (approximate translation from old Kehlami: "translucent polished stone", an irony if any, considering that the city's most prized pieces of jewelry are its famous rough-cut gems).</p>

      <h3>The Mid-Kings</h3>
      <p>Ever since its earliest days, the land of Harasor knew next to nothing of unity. A few powerful centers, fashioned around the half-dozen great and important cities of the peninsula saw the dawn of a darker era, known as The Age of the Mid-Kings. These self-proclaimed monarchs were ruthless rulers of different regions, with their base of operations situated in each district's capital city. Whether the fact that Verayn'eez has been situated in the same district as Rashii since the very beginning was beneficial in the long term is debateable: on the one hand, it was left to thrive primarily from its export industry over seas, the Serraszi thus seeing a rebirth of their power and influence, with little to no resistence from the district's ruling factions, but, on the other hand, it had no access to the structures of government and financial support that turned Rashii into a city three times as big, being the chosen capital. Out of all Harasoreni districts, Rashinem soon grew to be the largest and most powerful. Nevertheless, this was not a time of harmonious progress, but of descend into a chaotic spiral of squabbles, minor but continuous skirmishes between districts and devastating wars with the neighbouring nation of Bugkhorsz. This period of Harasi history keeps giving headaches to students to this day, and can be briefly summarized as: constant power struggles, martial law, despotic rule, succesive waves of conquering and liberations and persecution of minor tribal populations - including the Jelomoreni and Geldri of Verayn'eez. Although most of the Mid-Kings were Kehlami, the majority of those who turned into the most blood-thirsty of tyrants were Harasi (for instance, Garuyan the White and Tomovishyey Ironbreath) and, surprisingly enough, Jelomoreni (the most infamous one being the second-to-last Mid-King of the Rashinem District - Wghyrios the Unburnt, the patron of Rashii itself).</p>

      <h3>Fehlyen</h3>
      <p>"Fehlyen" (Harasi word) literally translates to "transition", a process which, for the city of Verayn'eez, lasted well over two centuries. Throughout this time, the city was governed by The Fehlii Council, a group of eight to ten elected officials (the numbers varied greatly depending on the decade). Chosen from the ranking families of each ethnic district, the Councillors were always a faithful mirror as to the ever shifting Veraynzi dynamics. Fehlyen was brought on by the disaster that was The Third (and final) Bugkhor War, in order to mend the broken ways of the Mid-Kings' Ruling Dinasties and allow for peaceful cohabitation between the ethnic groups. The city's most well known cultural customs - such as the Spring Festival, the Biannual Spiral Firenights and the Relenting of the Faithful - were all birthed during this time.</p>

      <h3>Verayn'eez nowadays</h3>
      <p>Even though formal unification of the Harasi Peninsula as Harasoren Federation was acheived fairly early in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the districts continued to be chiefly run by local Councils, belonging to the most powerful city in the immediate area, with minimum input or involvement from Rashii official legislators. Common ground was found more often than not, but regional and different cultural mixes still prevailed. The year 1997 brought on a thorough centralization process and the transformation of the Fehlii Councils to Delegations of the Harasoreni Federation, a change that was as peaceful as it had been long overdue. Today, Verayn'eez remains an important large city in the South-West of the Federation and a living testimony to this country's colourful past and unique blend of cultures.</p>
