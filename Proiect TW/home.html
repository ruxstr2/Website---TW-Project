    <p class="par"><span>C</span>onquest of none and home to many, the desert city of Verayn'eez has become a most beloved tourist destination in the Harasoreni Federation throughout the years. Now, it is second only to the Capital, a fact quite fitting, considering that the Shining City is a former capital itself - briefly, but still. Situated on the cost of the Geldren Sea, Verayn'eez has been and still is the gateway oasis to the great desert beyond, a unique abode of old legends come alive to tell glorious tales and enchant all those who visit it. However, the city's magnificent stories extend far beyond the epic feats of historical figures during fluctuating times of war and peace and can find their true roots in the ethnic diversity of beliefs which comprises the very soul of this desert gem. To celebrate 600 years of documentary attestation, our team has gathered our city's most notable urban myths and legends, from days of old to more recent times, along with a brief history and local symbols holding deeper meanings, captivating stories painting the ever surprising hues of a living entity - Verayn'eez itself.</p>

    <p class="par"><span>T</span>hus speaks the city's motto - a mix of old Kehlami and Serraszi Eastern Dialect. One can only wonder what our ancestors saw upon arriving on these shores that was able to inspire such deep reflections, but, alas, that is all we are capable of doing - wondering. While this motto holds true for all Veraynzi, regardless of ethnicity, the same can not be said about the official chevron - a mocking caricature if there ever was one. Check out the Symbols section if you want to learn more about this infamous crest.</p>
